# Security Policy

This policy is for if you find a security flaw that affects the system. 

## Definitions:
For the purposes of this policy, the following definitions apply:
- "Security flaw" - Refers to a issue in this mod that impacts the host system in a negative way.
- "Reporting" or "Report" - Refers to the action of issuing a post on the Issues tab about such indicents.

## Supported Versions

This mod supports MC version 1.21.x. You will need Java 21 or above to build it. If you use an unsupported version to build/run this mod and experince a security flaw, 
it is not a issue, its human error.

## Procedures

PREVENTING:
Since the mod is still in Alpha, errors are bound to occur. This is why I recommend the below steps before testing it.
- Close all other apps during testing procedure.
- Run in Safe Mode to ensure accurate data.
- Test inside a virtual machine (where applicable).
- Test mods on a USB drive (pull it out at the first signs of Security flaws).

COMBATTING:
In the case a security flaw occurs, the following prodecures are recommended.
- Recording the incident, along with the steps to recreate it.
- Record version, software versions (Minecraft/Fabric version).
- Post a Issue discussion about it ASAP.

Although security flaws are kept to a minimum, there is no guarrentee this early in testing. Please excerise caution when testing.
